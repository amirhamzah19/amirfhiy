  <h3>Introduction: Photographer</h3>
    <img src="img/amir.jpg" alt="Amirfhiy" class="img-amir">
  <p> Malaysian born, Amir Hamzah was diagnosed with a rare disorder which made him smaller in body size than anybody else.  This rare disorder which is known as Achondroplasia, makes Amir’s bone grow slowly. Even though born with these “flaws” he has managed to embrace the medical condition with the support of his family and friends. Photography has always been in the blood
of the family via his father, a hobby during his college days, and his older brother who does part-time commissioned digital photography. Self-taught, Amir style of photography revolves around using films, which produce photos that look old school and retro. Amir’s preference for using films, is also influenced by his favorite film photographer, George Muncey who is a photographer, editor, and curator based in London. Taking landscape photos has always been his style of photography rather than human portrait, as there is no directing and talking with the subject required when taking the photos; it suits his quiet personality. As his older sister would say, “Let Amir’s photos do the talking”. Amir uses his photos to advocate for the rare disorder community in raising awareness about the various type of rare disorders which could affect just anyone not limited to gender, race, or skin color.
